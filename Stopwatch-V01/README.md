# JS-pojects

Notes.

1- NOT RESPONSIVE. 

2- A Stopwatch with start, pause and reset functions. 

3- Start button makes a beep sound "onclick".

4- Experiments with CSS as background-image, Opacity, Linear gradient and Radial gradient. I also included some color like "fallback" if the browsers do not support gradients, or the background image can not be reached in Firebase.
